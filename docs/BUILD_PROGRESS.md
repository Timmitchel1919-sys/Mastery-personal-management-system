## Layer log

### Layer 0 — Project Constitution — ✅ complete (2026-08-27)

Governance and documentation only. No application code.

**Created:**
- `CLAUDE.md` — engineering constitution: repository/architecture rules, naming
  conventions, security & testing requirements, layer procedure, prohibited patterns,
  verification commands, git workflow, definition of done.
- `README.md` — project overview, stack, doc index, getting-started placeholder.
- `.gitignore` — Node / Next.js / Firebase / secrets / test artifacts.
- `docs/MASTER_SPEC.md` — consolidated product + build specification, build order table.
- `docs/PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md` — feature-level requirements per domain.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — layered model, directory structure, validation boundaries,
  repository pattern, state/data-fetching rules, provider abstraction, performance guardrails.
- `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — Mastery design language: principles, tokens, scales, layout
  system, component inventory, accessibility checklist, theming rules.
- `docs/DATA_MODEL.md` — Firestore collection map, common record fields, converters,
  linkage/traceability, indexing approach, index log.
- `docs/SECURITY.md` — identity/roles, Firestore & Storage rules, Cloud Functions, App
  Check, transport/browser security, environment separation, secret management, rules
  testing, per-layer security checkpoints.
- `docs/AI_ARCHITECTURE.md` — server-side AI, endpoints, context retrieval boundaries,
  request/response contract, infrastructure requirements, weekly summary, general↔recovery
  isolation.
- `docs/RECOVERY_PRIVACY.md` — Recovery Center privacy architecture, data model, access
  control, features, Recovery Coach, accountability partner, offline scrutiny, documented
  access-path table.
- `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` — test types, commands, per-layer gate, 24 critical journeys
  mapped to layers, conventions.
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` — environments, Firebase hosting model, CI/CD pipeline,
  configuration, runbook, pre-launch checklist.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — ADR-0001…0006 (fresh restart, single-branch, Firebase App Hosting,
  project-id slug, launch languages, 24-layer plan).
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — initialized (Keep a Changelog).

**Modified / moved / deleted:** none (fresh repository).

**Verification:** not applicable at this layer — no build/test tooling yet. Docs
cross-checked for internal consistency (collection names, layer numbers, endpoint names,
critical-journey mapping).

**Manual test instructions:**
1. `git log --oneline` shows the Layer 0 commit on `main`.
2. `CLAUDE.md` and all 14 `docs/*.md` files are present and readable.
3. Doc cross-links resolve (README doc index → each doc).
4. `git remote -v` points at the Mastery-personal-management-system repo.

**Known limitations:**
- Design-system token values are structural placeholders; exact values are set in Layer 2.
- `DATA_MODEL.md` index log is empty until domains add composite queries.
- Firebase project ids in `DEPLOYMENT.md` are TBD pending owner creation (ADR-0004).
- No executable verification exists until Layer 1.

## Known defects

_None._

## Technical debt

_None yet._

## Deferred features

- Spanish localization content (architecture prepared in Layer 18; content deferred — ADR-0005).
- External calendar sync (Google / Outlook / CalDAV) — deferred until the internal calendar
  is stable (post-Layer 9C).
- Biometric / WebAuthn recovery gate — architected in Layer 15A, implemented later; PIN
  first.
